# Ito_Moore_Thrust_Spacing
Source code and example input files
This folder contains MATLAB code for running the numerical wedge models of
Ito & Moore GJI (2020), using the MATLAB based finite-difference code
SiStER (See github.com/jaolive/SiStER), Olive et al., GJI, 205, 728-743.

To run the model shown in Fig. 7b run the script "phib20phi10C10H3lam0Bet0.m

The second piece of code "Combing_Scaling_CriticalWedgeTheory.m" produces 
solutions for sediment and basal friction based on measurements of w0,H,
alpha, and beta.  It produces Fig. 14 of Ito & Moore.
